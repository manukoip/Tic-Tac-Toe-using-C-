# Tic-Tac-Toe-using-C-
Tic-Tac-Toe game made in C++. This is my grade 12 final project for my Computer Science Class. 
The program has 2 player options:
- 1-player option, where the system is the second playeer. The second number is selected by using the randomize function of C++
- 2-player option, where 2 users can play the game.
